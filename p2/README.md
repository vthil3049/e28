# Project 2
+ By: Vani Thilagar
+ Production URL: <http://e28p2.thilagar.com>

The purpose for this app to function as a Flyer/Brochure for a school talent show.


## Pages summary
1. The Home page has a video running in a loop and contains the event information for the show.
2. The Program page shows the list of items, their description and performers that will perform on the day of the event.
3. The CreditsPage is a fictitious list of people(Adult staff + students) who are responsible for organizing the show

## SFC summary
1. App.Vue - contains header and footer pages + router-outlet
2. HeaderPage.Vue - common header
3. FooterPage.Vue - common footer
4. HomePage.vue - Landing page
5. ProgramPage.vue - List of items
5. CreditsPage.vue - Event day credits

## Server interaction
1. App.vue - on mounting, calls utils.js method to
* init firebase
* refresh the data model (program) - this calls the Firebase backend to get the list of items
2. ProgramPage.vue - on mounting calls utils.js to retrieve the current data model (program)

## Outside resources
* Used **faker** - https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker for generating names in the Credits Page. Notice the names change when you refresh that page :)
* Home page video generated by https://www.postermywall.com/

## Notes for instructor

This is much skinnier version of the app that I originally had in mind. Ran out of time to complete all that I wanted. I hope to make it better by p3.
