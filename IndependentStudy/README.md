# ECMAScript is not just for the web

Javascript originated in 1995 for the popular NetScape browser. NetScape partnered with Sun to prevent Microsoft from monopolizing the browser market with its Interenet Explorer. It became an ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) standard in 1997 and has evolved from the early ECMAScript 1 to  ECMScript 2015 or ES6 or Typescript.

The original intent of Javascript was as a scripting language for use in browsers, which were applications that provided the front end GUI on any platform. This inherent feature of ECMAScript made it an ideal candidate for creating platform agnostic applications.
